#Game of Life Simulator
This Java application runs Conway's Game of Life.  You can plant new living cells by clicking in individual grid cells, or dragging across a connected sequence of grid cells and then releasing the mouse.  You can also set the speed and grid size of the animation.

Of course, there are countless online apps that do essentially the same thing. The purpose of this application was to show my Grade 12 students how to create simple Swing GUIs for animated simulations in Java.
